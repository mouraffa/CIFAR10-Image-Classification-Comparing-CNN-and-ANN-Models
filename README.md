# CIFAR10 Image Classification using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ansd Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

This project demonstrates image classification using the CIFAR10 dataset in TensorFlow. It compares the performance of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this task. The purpose is to understand why CNNs are preferred over ANNs for image classification.

## Dataset

The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image belongs to one of the ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Usage
01. Open the Jupyter Notebook CIFAR10_Image_Classification.ipynb in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment.

02. Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially to train the models and evaluate their performance.

03. Follow the comments and explanations provided in the notebook to understand the code and the process of image classification using CNN and ANN.

04. Compare the accuracy and performance of the CNN and ANN models on the CIFAR10 dataset.
