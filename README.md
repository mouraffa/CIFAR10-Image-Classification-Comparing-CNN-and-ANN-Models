# CIFAR10 Image Classification using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ansd Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

This project demonstrates image classification using the CIFAR10 dataset in TensorFlow. It compares the performance of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this task. The purpose is to understand why CNNs are preferred over ANNs for image classification.

## Dataset

The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image belongs to one of the ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn
